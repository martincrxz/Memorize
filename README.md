# Memorize

This is the first project of Stanford CS193p spring quarter 2020.

This is my personal follow up of the leactures and assignments, which are now open to the public.

## Lecture 1

### Computed properties

Struct's or class' property that is calculated on access. In the next example, `body` is a calculated property:

````swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
    }
}
```

In this case, `body` is a read-only calculated property, in (https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html#)[https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html#] there's information about all types of properties.
